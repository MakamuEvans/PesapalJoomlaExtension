Joomla extension for Pesapal

## Getting Started

This is a Demo project and thus will solely rely on Pesapal Demo API end-points

### Prerequisites


```
1. Demo Pesapal account at https://www.demo.pesapal.com
2. Complete Joomla-Core Installation with a running server
```

### Installation and usage

Installation is solely dependent on the method you are more familiar with

I'll use the package installation method

```
1. Log into your Joomla Backend.
2. Under "Extensions" menu, click on "Manage" and then "Install"
3. You can Drag the project zip into the upload area or use the browser's file manager to import the zip file
4. The Component will automatically install and you should receive a success message.
5. You can access the component from "Components" menu and click on "COM_DONATE" for backend and append index.php?option=com_donate to front-end base url.
```

Remember

```
Set your key and secret as obtained from demo.pesapal.com, under the component's configuration settings.
```
